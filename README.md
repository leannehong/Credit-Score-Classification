# Credit-Score-Classification

This project was done in Jupyter Notebook, using Python programming language and several popular data analysis and machine learning libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and sklearn.

I began with exploratory data analysis to understand insights into the data and the relationships between various features and the credit score. After understanding the data, I created models of the relationship with credit score.

Next, I train and evaluate by using Random Forest Classifier to help create predicts from our model.

Finally, the user can use our model by inputting their information to determine their credit score.
